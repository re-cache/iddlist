## IDDlist To-do

* Title standardization and consistency across US-English, Japanese, and UK-English
* Title standardization for Japanese romaji without using diacritics/diacritical marks (Nihon-shiki? Kunrei-shiki?)
* Accuracy check for title names and BG (background) entries
  * Redump links for discs
  * YouTube links for BGMs
* Document `integrated.txt` differences and functions
  * List disc intro animation differences

**Requested**
* Alternate data page with non-romaji Japanese titles
* Buttons for flipping between pages in browser for filtering US, EU, Aus, and JP interactive discs by region
 
**Potential to-do**
* Provide "fix" files to easily re-enable hidden or inaccessible content back onto menus.
